## Self-Hosting

### Docker Run / Docker Compose

This is a container template for hosting uvdesk on [unRAID](https://unraid.net/). If you are not using unRAID, there are better `docker-compose` and `docker-run` templates out there, such as the base for this unRAID image, [dietermartens/uvdesk](https://hub.docker.com/r/dietermartens/uvdesk/).

### Non-Docker Setup

If you're looking to install this on a non-containerized system, look to UVDesk's [Official Install Guide](https://github.com/uvdesk/community-skeleton#installation).


### unRAID

Alright, the main event and what this template is made for. If you're running unRAID you should be able to find this template underneath the **Productivity** or **Tools** sections in Community Applications, or by searching for `uvdesk`.
